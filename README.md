# iching

written in python 3, nothing special (unless you count the infinite as being special, but that's kind of counter to the entire concept of the infinite).

*hexDictionary.py* was going to be a dict with the text of the book of changes nicely organized so that when you threw a hexagram the translation, if not the interpretation, would be at your fingertips but jeez all the typing.

*iching.txt* is the wilhelm translation in plaintext. i just search for the hexagram number after i throw

*ichingpy3.py* is like version 4 or something; i learned a lot (having come from a background of 0 python, i had nowhere to go but up).

*ichingpy3_twomethods.py* has the option to either use the three coin method, or the four coin method, the probabilities of which match the yarrow stalk method, which one day i will write. pass the method along at the command line, eg

```bash
python3 ichingpy3_twomethods.py 3
```
